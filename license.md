NVIDIA VIDEO CODEC SDK LICENSE AGREEMENT (“Agreement”)

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE AND OTHER AVAILABLE MATERIALS, YOU 
(“LICENSEE”) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS 
AGREEMENT.  If Licensee does not agree to the terms and condition of this Agreement, 
THEN do not downLOAD, INSTALL OR USE the SOFTWARE AND MATERIALS.

The materials available for download to Licensees may include software in both 
sample source code ("Source Code") and object code ("Object Code") versions 
(collectively, the “Software”), documentation and other materials (collectively, 
these code and materials referred to herein as "Licensed Materials").  Except as 
expressly indicated herein, all terms and conditions of this Agreement apply to all 
of the Licensed Materials.

Except as expressly set forth herein, NVIDIA owns all of the Licensed Materials and 
makes them available to Licensee only under the terms and conditions set forth in 
this Agreement.

License:  Subject to Licensee’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA 
grants to Licensee a nonexclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully 
paid-up license and right to install, use, reproduce, display, perform, modify the 
Source Code of the Software, and to prepare and have prepared derivative works 
thereof, and distribute the Software and derivative works thereof (in object code 
only) as integrated in Licensee software products solely for use with supported 
NVIDIA GPU hardware products as specified in the accompanying release notes.  The 
following terms apply to the Licensed Material:

Derivative Works:  Subject to the License Grant Back below, Licensee shall own any 
Derivative Works it creates directly to the Source Code that integrates with 
Licensee’s software product ("Modification(s)") subject to NVIDIA’s ownership of the 
underlying Source Code and all intellectual property rights therein. 

Distribution: Licensee may distribute the Software (in object code form) integrated 
with Licensee software products only to Licensee’s authorized distributors, 
resellers, and others in Licensee’s distribution chain for Licensee product and end 
users and grant to such third party a sublicense to use the Software under a 
written, legally enforceable agreement that has the effect of protecting the 
Software and the rights of NVIDIA under terms no less restrictive than this 
Agreement.

Limitations: Unless otherwise authorized in the Agreement, Licensee shall not 
otherwise assign, sublicense, lease, or in any other way transfer or disclose 
Software to any third party. Licensee agrees not to disassemble, decompile or 
reverse engineer the Object Code or use or modify any of the Licensed Materials to 
enable screen scraping, data scraping, or any other activity with the purpose of 
capturing copyright protected content in violation of a third party party’s 
intellectual property or other proprietary rights.  Licensee shall indemnify NVIDIA 
for any and all claims, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs arising from 
Licensee’s breach of the foregoing limitations. 

License Grant Back:Licensee hereby grants to NVIDIA and its affiliates a worldwide, 
non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, sublicenseable (through multiple tiers of 
sublicensees), royalty-free and fully paid-up right and license to the 
Modification(s) created by or on behalf of Licensee so that NVIDIA may copy, modify, 
create derivatives works thereof, to use, have used, import, make, have made, sell, 
offer to sell, sublicense (through multiple tiers of sublicensees), distribute 
(through multiple tiers of distributors) such derivative work(s) on a stand-alone 
basis or as incorporated into the Licensed Materials or other related technologies.  
For the sake of clarity, NVIDIA is not prohibited or otherwise restricted from 
independently developing new features or functionality with respect to the Licensed 
Materials

No Other License:No rights or licenses with respect to any proprietary information 
or patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right owned or 
controlled by NVIDIA are granted by NVIDIA to Licensee under this Agreement, 
expressly or by implication, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. 

Confidentiality: If applicable, any exchange of Confidential Information (as defined 
in the NDA) shall be made pursuant to the terms and conditions of a separately 
signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (“NDA”) by and between NVIDIA and You. For the sake 
of clarity, You agree that (a) the Software (in source code form); and (b) Your use 
of the Software is considered Confidential Information of NVIDIA.

If You wish to have a third party consultant or subcontractor ("Contractor") perform 
work on Your behalf which involves access to or use of Software, You shall obtain a 
written confidentiality agreement from the Contractor which contains terms and 
obligations with respect to access to or use of Software no less restrictive than 
those set forth in this Agreement and excluding any distribution or sublicense 
rights, and use for any other purpose than permitted in this Agreement. Otherwise, 
You shall not disclose the terms or existence of this Agreement or use NVIDIA's name 
in any publications, advertisements, or other announcements without NVIDIA's prior 
written consent.  Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, You do not have any 
rights to use any NVIDIA trademarks or logos.

Intellectual Property Ownership: Except as expressly licensed to Licensee under this 
Agreement, NVIDIA reserves all right, title and interest, including but not limited 
to all intellectual property rights, in and to the Licensed Materials and any 
derivative work(s) made thereto. The algorithms, structure, organization and Source 
Code are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information of NVIDIA.

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that it is Licensee’s sole responsibility to obtain 
any, additional, third party licenses required to make, have made, use, have used, 
sell, import, and offer for sale Licensee products that include or incorporate any 
third party technology such as operating systems, audio and/or video encoders and 
decoders or any technology from, including but not limited to, Microsoft, Thomson, 
Fraunhofer IIS, Sisvel S.p.A., MPEG-LA, and Coding Technologies (“Third Party 
Technology”).  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that NVIDIA has not granted to 
Licensee under this Agreement any necessary patent rights with respect to the Third 
Party Technology.  As such, Licensee’s use of the Third Party Technology may be 
subject to further restrictions and terms and conditions.  Licensee acknowledges and 
agrees that Licensee is solely and exclusively responsible for obtaining any and all 
authorizations and licenses required for the use, distribution and/or incorporation 
of the Third Party Technology.

Licensee shall, at its own expense fully indemnify, hold harmless, defend and/or 
settle any claim, suit or proceeding that is asserted by a third party against 
NVIDIA and its officers, employees or agents, to the extent such claim, suit or 
proceeding arising from or related to Licensee’s failure to fully satisfy and/or 
comply with the third party licensing obligations related to the Third Party 
Technology (a “Claim”).  In the event of a Claim, Licensee agrees to: (a) pay all 
damages or settlement amounts, which shall not be finalized without the prior 
written consent of NVIDIA, (including other reasonable costs incurred by NVIDIA, 
including reasonable attorneys fees, in connection with enforcing this paragraph); 
(b) reimburse NVIDIA for any licensing fees and/or penalties incurred by NVIDIA in 
connection with a Claim; and (c) immediately procure/satisfy the third party 
licensing obligations before using the Software pursuant to this Agreement.

Term of Agreement:  This Agreement shall become effective from the date of the 
initial download and shall remain in effect for one year thereafter, unless 
terminated as provided below.  Unless either party notifies the other party of its 
intent to terminate this Agreement at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the 
Initial Term or the applicable renewal period, this Agreement will be automatically 
renewed for one (1) year renewal periods thereafter, unless terminated in accordance 
with the “Termination” provision of this Agreement.

NVIDIA may terminate this Agreement (and with it, all of Licensee’s right to the 
Licensed Materials) if (i) Licensee fails to comply with any of the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement and if the breach is not cured within thirty (30) days 
after notice thereof. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement pursuant to 
this paragraph, Licensee shall immediately cease using the Licensed Materials and 
return or destroy or copies thereof in its possession.

Defensive Suspension:If Licensee commences or participates in any legal proceeding 
against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate all 
license grants and any other rights provided under this Agreement.

No Support:  NVIDIA has no obligation to support or to continue providing or 
updating any of the Licensed Materials.

PROVIDED "AS IS."  NVIDIA DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Limitation of Liability: NVIDIA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE, LICENSEE’S 
CUSTOMERS, OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY CLAIMING THROUGH OR UNDER LICENSEE FOR ANY 
LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, SAVINGS, OR ANY OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, 
PUNITIVE, DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT OR 
BASED ON A WARRANTY), EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES.  THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL 
PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.  IN NO EVENT SHALL NVIDIA’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO 
LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY CLAIMING THROUGH OR UNDER LICENSEE EXCEED THE 
AMOUNT OF MONEY ACTUALLY PAID BY LICENSEE TO NVIDIA FOR THE LICENSED MATERIALS.

Applicable Law and Jurisdiction: This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made 
in, and shall be construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of Delaware. The state

to Licensee under this Agreement (collectively, “Licensee Feedback”).  NVIDIA may 
use and include any Licensee Feedback that Licensee voluntarily provides to improve 
the Licensed Materials or other related NVIDIA technologies.  Accordingly, if 
Licensee provides Licensee Feedback, Licensee grants NVIDIA and its licensees a 
perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up license grant to 
freely use, have used, sell, modify, reproduce, transmit, license, sublicense

extent necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law. This 
Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement between the parties
